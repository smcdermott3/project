  <p> Music, and Hip-Hop has dominated my life since childhood. On this site, you'll be able to find my 
      music reviews and delve deeper into the world of Hip-Hop, and hopefully come out with a bit more knowledge
      than when you came in.

     <h3><b>Kanye West - Devil in a New Dress</b></h3>  
     <p> As the song begins, the listener is quickly taken in by the angelic vocals in the background.
        In a few short seconds, West’s lyrics come in to introduce the theme of the song -- that although 
        he may be Holy, the Devil forever tempts him with sin of (in this example) lust. Throughout his verses,
         his raw emotion is seen in full display as he grapples with the struggle of the dualities. After some 
         time, a welcome but distorted guitar creeps in with a transic solo until the beat swells and Rick 
         Ross’ burley voice fills the songs. Ross offers a braggadocious verse full of excess and offers 
         little in the way of emotion, but for some reason his verse just fits.
        This is one of Kanye West’s best songs to date, and just an absolute joy to listen to.

     <h3><b>YG - Meet the Flockers</b></h3>  
     <p> When first listening to YG’s debut album, My Krazy Life, I was immediately brought in by the detail of the song. 
        The album as a whole is a trip through the life of a gang member in South Central Los Angeles, and this song walks 
        the listener to a home invasion by YG and his crew. The lyrics are calculated and cold, yet somehow draws you in 
        and has you rooting for the criminals. Moments of vulnerability, fear even, peak through the macho-ness of the 
        song to allow a glimpse into the psyche of the criminals. This is one of the primary reasons I enjoy Hip-Hop; 
        songs are able to tell stories of topics I have no relation to and therefore I am able to see into others’ lives.
        </p>
