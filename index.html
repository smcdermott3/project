<h3>Kanye West - Devil in a New Dress</h3>
<p>
    As the song begins, the listener is quickly taken in by the angelic vocals in the background.
    In a few short seconds, West’s lyrics come in to introduce the theme of the song -- that although 
    he may be Holy, the Devil forever tempts him with sin of (in this example) lust. Throughout his verses,
     his raw emotion is seen in full display as he grapples with the struggle of the dualities. After some 
     time, a welcome but distorted guitar creeps in with a transic solo until the beat swells and Rick 
     Ross’ burley voice fills the songs. Ross offers a braggadocious verse full of excess and offers 
     little in the way of emotion, but for some reason his verse just fits.
    This is one of Kanye West’s best songs to date, and just an absolute joy to listen to.
