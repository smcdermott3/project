    <h2>
      <span id="first_word">The</span> origins of 
      <span id="last_word"> Hip-Hop.</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      A faint thud of the bass emanated from the apartment of DJ Kool Herc in the Bronx during one of his parties. 
      Little did he know, he had just started a movement: Hip-Hop. His experimentalism with 
      sampling and scratching quickly proliferated to become much more. People were getting more 
      complex with their beats and detailed in their layers. Simultaneously, MCs, would 
      throw out catch phrases at parties along to these beats. But as the beats became more 
      complex, so did the rhymes. By today's standard, these were still primitive, but were truly 
      groundbreaking at the time. Meter, rhyming, and flow were all being experimented at this time, 
      with each iteration progressing the sound to what we know today.

      <span id="first_word">New York</span> explodes in
      <span id="last_word"> popularity.</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
     As Hip-Hop was beginning to see its foothold, MCs began seeing popularity. It became less of a hobby
     and more of a modest living to many artists. Yet the genre kept growing and kept becoming lucrative. Its 
     sphere of influence was growing and people saw this as an opportunity to speak out against 
     social issues. However, even with these pushes, Hip-Hop was fairly sanitized.  Hip-Hop was only profitable 
     if it was played over the radio or at nightclubs, so rappers tended to shy away from 
     the gritty reality of urban life. Songs that did talk about these issues were often 
     mascaraed over happy beats and performed by people in intricate, showroom costumes.

    <h2>
        <span id="first_word">West Coast</span> begins to
        <span id="last_word"> emerge.</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       It took some time for Hip-Hop to jump coasts to Los Angeles, but when it did,
       the artists did more than run with it. A gritty realism emerged that truly dove into
       the social and political issues of the day. Most famous for this is the group, N.W.A., whose
       ultra-realistic lyrics depicting gang violence and police brutality shocked the 
       nation. Unlike previous artists, N.W.A. did not need to rely on radio sales to make 
       revenue. Instead, they were marketed as being un-marketable. Their lyrics pushed First Amendment 
       boundaries and got the Federal Bureau of Investigation involved.

      <h2>
        <span id="first_word">The</span> Tale of Two
        <span id="last_word"> Cities.</span>
      </h2>
      <p>
       As both West Coast and East Coast were developing, two important figures were 
       borne. Tupac, on the West, and the Notorious B.I.G., on the East, came into prominence 
       and were both hailed to be some of the best MCs ever. What started as friendship slowly
       turned into a feud and each Coast armed up. Hip-Hop became violent, both in lyrics and 
       actions. Turf wars divided Hip-Hop and made each Coast deeply territorial. 
       The years of 1996 and 1997 saw the death of Tupac and Biggie, respectively, as 
       Hip-Hop had reached a new level of ferocious limits.
