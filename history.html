    <p>
      A faint thud of the bass emanated from the apartment of DJ Kool Herc in
      the Bronx during one of his parties. Little did he know, he had just
      started a movement: Hip-Hop. His experimentalism with sampling and
      scratching quickly proliferated to become much more. People were getting
      more complex with their beats and detailed in their layers.
      Simultaneously, MCs, would throw out catch phrases at parties along to
      these beats. But as the beats became more complex, so did the rhymes. By
      today's standard, these were still primitive, but were truly
      groundbreaking at the time. Meter, rhyming, and flow were all being
      experimented at this time, with each iteration progressing the sound to
      what we know today.

      <span id="first_word">New York</span> explodes in
      <span id="last_word"> popularity.</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      As Hip-Hop was beginning to see its foothold, MCs began seeing popularity.
      It became less of a hobby and more of a modest living to many artists. Yet
      the genre kept growing and kept becoming lucrative. Its sphere of
      influence was growing and people saw this as an opportunity to speak out
      against social issues. However, even with these pushes, Hip-Hop was fairly
      sanitized. Hip-Hop was only profitable if it was played over the radio or
      at nightclubs, so rappers tended to shy away from the gritty reality of
      urban life. Songs that did talk about these issues were often mascaraed
      over happy beats and performed by people in intricate, showroom costumes.

      It took some time for Hip-Hop to jump coasts to Los Angeles, but when it
      did, the artists did more than run with it. A gritty realism emerged that
      truly dove into the social and political issues of the day. Most famous
      for this is the group, N.W.A., whose ultra-realistic lyrics depicting gang
      violence and police brutality shocked the nation. Unlike previous artists,
      N.W.A. did not need to rely on radio sales to make revenue. Instead, they
      were marketed as being un-marketable. Their lyrics pushed First Amendment
      boundaries and got the Federal Bureau of Investigation involved.

    <h2>
      <span id="first_word">The</span> Tale of Two
      <span id="last_word"> Cities.</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      As both West Coast and East Coast were developing, two important figures
      were borne. Tupac, from Los Angeles, and the Notorious B.I.G., from New
      York City, came into prominence and were both hailed to be some of the
      best MCs ever. What started as friendship slowly turned into a feud and
      each Coast armed up. Hip-Hop became violent, both in lyrics and actions.
      Turf wars divided Hip-Hop and made each Coast deeply territorial. The
      years of 1996 and 1997 saw the death of Tupac and Biggie, respectively, as
      Hip-Hop had reached a new level of ferocious limits. If took a few years
      for level heads to prevail and the Coasts to come to terms, but there are
      still remaining traces of the feud.
    </p>

    <h2>
      <span id="first_word">Return</span> to the party
      <span id="last_word"> scene.</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The darkest time in Hip-Hop had come and gone, but because the artists
      were going through turmoil doesn't mean the genre was. Listenership
      exploded during the '90s and Hip-Hop had found a new demographic;
      suburbia. This new demographic also demanded less realism and, in a way,
      return to Hip-Hop's roots by encouraging party music. The subgenre to come
      out of this was called "crunk" and saw many artists rapping over
      infectious beats that were easy to dance along with. Instead of the West
      or East pioneering this sound, though, a new player came to take over:
      Atlanta and the greater South. To this day, the South is perhaps one of
      the largest exporters of Hip-Hop and is certainly the largest consumer of
      such. The South characterized stripped down beats and heavy bass, which
      added to its appeal around the nation. That isn't to say there weren't
      prolific rappers of this time, but it certainly took some digging. The
      South also formally introduced hard, recreational drugs to the scene,
      which unfortunately is still a problem.

      Hip-Hop, being a young genre geared towards the youth, was quick to adapt
      to the coming of the Internet. People in New York were exposed to Houston,
      who were exposed to Atlanta, who were exposed to LA. Sounds are beginning
      to blend regions as the world is becoming smaller. It's not uncommon to
      see Drake, a Toronto-based artist, jump on a track with Future (Atlanta)
      and turn around to see him with the Game (LA). In recent years,
      international artists from the UK and other international markets have
      gained traction. Hip-Hop is even seeing its impacts in other genres, as
      anywhere from EDM to country to pop is borrowing elements of Hip-Hop. Rap
      is now the most consumed genre of music in the world, surpassing rock a
      few years ago, and it is exciting to see where the story will go next. In
      the meantime, regional sounds and distinct genres can still be identified.
