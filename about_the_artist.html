     <h3><b>Kanye West</b></h3>  
     <p>This Chicago, South Side native started off as a producer, but 
         burst on the scene with his 2003 album "College Dropout." Over the years, 
        West has been known for both his crazy antics yet musical genius. West has been responsible 
        for many musical evolutions throughout Hip-Hop, but is most often revered for his 
        pioneering in perfecting sampling. West also is able to stand apart from the crowd by offering 
        consistently new sounds for each album, from Yeezus' industrial cacophony to Graduation's
        soulful mix, West is always bringing new sounds to the public's attention.

     <h3><b>YG</b></h3>  
     <p> Perhaps the leading force of Gangsta Rap right now, YG is from Compton, California and an 
         outspoken gang member of the Bloods. With his previous experience in gang activity, YG 
         is able to draw listeners in to the gang-banging mentality through his songs. Though YG has 
         been making moves into other sounds - slower or more party tunes - he is still 
         unmistakeably YG.

    <div class="container">
     <h3><b>Jack Harlow</b></h3>  
     <p>Jack Harlow burst onto the scene with "What's Poppin," but Jack Harlow has been on the rise even before that. 
         This rapper comes from Louisville, Kentucky, and is representing the 502 well. He's funny and quirky, yet 
         still manages to go in hard on his beats. His rapping ability has gained him respect in the Hip-Hop game, and is 
         one of the best new rappers of the past couple of years.

     <h3><b>dvsn</b></h3>  
     <p>Toronto, Canada is perhaps one of the most successful cities in terms of Hip-Hop outside of the United States, and 
         one group that comes out of Toronta is dvsn. Signed to Drake's OVO Sounds, the singer Daniel Daley and producer Nineteen85 
         has made plenty of hits with thick bass and smooth vocals. Strangely, dvsn is one of those groups that many people know 
         of, and admire, but don't follow too closely.

    alt="Action Bronson" title="Action Bronson Staring Off Stage" height="200px" width="200px">
    <div class="container">
     <h3><b>Action Bronson</b></h3>  
     <p>Bronson has one of the most unique come-ups in Hip-Hop. Starting in New York, Bronson was actually a 
         gourmet chef previous to rapping. An injury in the kitchen then inspired a career change, and Bronson began 
         rapping full-time. His lyrics, fittingly, is full of colorful food descriptions. Yet, what stands out the most 
         about him is his humor through his songs, which never fail to entertain. Bronson is certainly 
         niche, but those who enjoy him thoroughly do.

    alt="Manila Grey" title="Manila Grey in Red Light" height="200px">
    <div class="container">
     <h3><b>Manila Grey</b></h3>  
     <p>The rising duo hails from Manila, Philippines but now resides in 
         Vancouver, Canada. This duo is making moves in the underground and gaining popularity
        fast, with hits starting to come into the mainstream. The group came into existence 
        in 2016 by the merger of Filipinos Neeko and Soliven, whose voices both
        contrast and compliment each other on spacey beats.</p>

    <div class="container">
     <h3><b>Kendrick Lamar</b></h3>  
     <p>Hailed as the best rapper of this generation, Lamar is able to talk about many issues spanning from 
         race relations, spirituality, gang life, poverty, and more. Lamar is the only rapper to win a 
         Pulitzer Prize for his album "Damn.", but his works from Section 80 on have talked about a multitude of issues 
         with complex lyricism. His debut studio album, "good kid, m.A.A.d. city" brought him into the mainstream 
         with a concept album that has been one of the most proclaimed Hip-Hop albums ever, and is often titled as a 
         modern day classic.
