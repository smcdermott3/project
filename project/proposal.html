  <h1>Project Proposal</h1>
  <h2>What will my website be about?</h2>
  <p>Ever since a young age, I've been enthralled by Hip-Hop. 
      I remember the first Hip-Hop song I ever heard; I was in the back-left seat of 
      my mom's car, pulling into the driveway of my grandparents, and "Mockingbird" by Eminem came on the radio.
      If my mom had noticed, she'd have changed the station. But she was too busy talking to my 
      older brother. The story-telling captured me, brought me in, and engaged me.
      Though I, a suburban kid, could not relate to the music, it was an experience like no 
       other story had done before.</p>
 <p>Seeing as Hip-Hop has had such a profound impact on my life, I would like to
        make a website dedicated to me reviewing Hip-Hop songs. To take the reader
        through my emotions and reactions as I listen to a song and to hopefully expand 
        the reader's awareness of different types of Hip-Hop. </p>
<h2>What is the objective of my webiste?</h2>
<p>Hip-Hop has had a profound impact on my life. Hopefully, I can show
    the reader the beautiful intricacies of Hip-Hop. Rap is often frought with
    stereotypes about the music, and I'd like to peel back those stereotypes and expose
    the reader to various types of subgenres. </p>
<p> Contrarily, the reader may know or enjoy Hip-Hop, so in that case I hope to show them new songs that may pique their
    interest and expand their pallette.
<p>Ultimately, I will be rating these songs. The website will provide a glimpse into how
    I process and listen to songs, what aspects are important to me, or what stands out. This
    website is about education, but also about showing the pinnacle of rap.</p>
<h2>Who is my target audience?</h2>
