    <h2>
      <span id="first_word">What</span> will my website be
      <span id="last_word"> about?</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Ever since a young age, I've been enthralled by Hip-Hop. I remember the
      first Hip-Hop song I ever heard; I was in the back-left seat of my mom's
      car, pulling into the driveway of my grandparents, and "Mockingbird" by
      Eminem came on the radio. If my mom had noticed, she'd have changed the
      station. But she was too busy talking to my older brother. The
      story-telling captured me, brought me in, and engaged me. Though I, a
      suburban kid, could not relate to the music, it was an experience like no
      other story had done before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing as Hip-Hop has had such a profound impact on my life, I would like
      to make a website dedicated to me reviewing Hip-Hop songs. To take the
      reader through my emotions and reactions as I listen to a song and to
      hopefully expand the reader's awareness of different types of Hip-Hop.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span id="first_word">What</span> is the objective of my
      <span id="last_word"> website?</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      Hip-Hop has had a profound impact on my life. Hopefully, I can show the
      reader the beautiful intricacies of Hip-Hop. Rap is often fraught with
      stereotypes about the music, and I'd like to peel back those stereotypes
      and expose the reader to various types of sub-genres.
    </p>
    <p>
      Contrarily, the reader may know or enjoy Hip-Hop, so in that case I hope
      to show them new songs that may pique their interest and expand their
      pallette.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ultimately, I will be rating these songs. The website will provide a
      glimpse into how I process and listen to songs, what aspects are important
      to me, or what stands out. This website is about education, but also about
      showing the pinnacle of rap.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span id="first_word">Who</span> is my target
      <span id="last_word"> audience?</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      My target audience for the website will be primarily people who don't know
      Hip-Hop. I plan to deliver the content and reviews in a digestible manner,
      yet intricate enough where a Hip-Hop Head can also enjoy this site. While,
      by nature, Hip-Hop is aimed primarily at people 15y/o to 35ish y/o, I will
      not let this limit me. While there will be explicit lyrics in the song I
      review, I will not include expletives in my reviews, thus making the
      website kid-friendly and SFW. I also hope that this website can offer
      legitimacy into the Hip-Hop world so that older people may approach the
      genre differently, or at least with a new eye.
    </p>
    <h2>
      <span id="first_word">What</span> content will be on each
      <span id="last_word"> page?</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      The content will be fairly straight forward; name of the song, artist,
      album, length, explicit or not, my review, and my favorite lyric. The bulk
      of the content on the page will be my review of the song at hand. On
      occasion, linking album art, photos of the artist, or music videos will be
      included. I would like to include Spotify links to each song so hopefully
      that isn't too hard to implement. If it is, YouTube will do.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make 4 pages of content, I can also include pages on rappers' bios,
      Hip-Hop trivia, history of Hip-Hop, and other songs which I recommend (but
      don't review) (probably in the form of playlists). There are endless
      possibilities, and they are subject to change, but that can be a start of
      what I'd include.
