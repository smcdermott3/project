  <h2><span id="first_word">What</span> will my website be <span id="last_word"> about?</span></h2>
  <p>Ever since a young age, I've been enthralled by Hip-Hop. 
      I remember the first Hip-Hop song I ever heard; I was in the back-left seat of 
      my mom's car, pulling into the driveway of my grandparents, and "Mockingbird" by Eminem came on the radio.
      If my mom had noticed, she'd have changed the station. But she was too busy talking to my 
      older brother. The story-telling captured me, brought me in, and engaged me.
      Though I, a suburban kid, could not relate to the music, it was an experience like no 
       other story had done before.</p>
 <p>Seeing as Hip-Hop has had such a profound impact on my life, I would like to
        make a website dedicated to me reviewing Hip-Hop songs. To take the reader
        through my emotions and reactions as I listen to a song and to hopefully expand 
        the reader's awareness of different types of Hip-Hop. </p>
<h2><span id="first_word">What</span> is the objective of my <span id="last_word"> website?</span></h2>
<p>Hip-Hop has had a profound impact on my life. Hopefully, I can show
    the reader the beautiful intricacies of Hip-Hop. Rap is often fraught with
    stereotypes about the music, and I'd like to peel back those stereotypes and expose
    the reader to various types of sub-genres. </p>
<p> Contrarily, the reader may know or enjoy Hip-Hop, so in that case I hope to show them new songs that may pique their
    interest and expand their pallette. </p>
<p>Ultimately, I will be rating these songs. The website will provide a glimpse into how
    I process and listen to songs, what aspects are important to me, or what stands out. This
    website is about education, but also about showing the pinnacle of rap.</p>
<h2><span id="first_word">Who</span> is my target <span id="last_word"> audience?</span></h2>
<p> My target audience for the website will be primarily people who don't know Hip-Hop. 
    I plan to deliver the content and reviews in a digestible manner, yet intricate enough 
    where a Hip-Hop Head can also enjoy this site. While, by nature, Hip-Hop is aimed
    primarily at people 15y/o to 35ish y/o, I will not let this limit me. 
    While there will be explicit lyrics in the song I review, I will not include expletives in my
    reviews, thus making the website kid-friendly and SFW. I also hope that this website 
    can offer legitimacy into the Hip-Hop world so that older people may approach the genre
    differently, or at least with a new eye. </p>
<h2><span id="first_word">What</span> content will be on each <span id="last_word"> page?</span></h2>
<p>The content will be fairly straight forward; name of the song, artist, album, length, explicit or not, my review, and my favorite lyric.
    The bulk of the content on the page will be my review of the song at hand. On occasion, linking album art,
    photos of the artist, or music videos will be included. I would like to include Spotify links to each song so 
    hopefully that isn't too hard to implement. If it is, YouTube will do. </p>
<p>To make 4 pages of content, I can also include pages on rappers' bios, Hip-Hop trivia, history of Hip-Hop, and other songs which 
    I recommend (but don't review) (probably in the form of playlists). There are endless possibilities, and they are subject to change, but that can be 
    a start of what I'd include.</p>
